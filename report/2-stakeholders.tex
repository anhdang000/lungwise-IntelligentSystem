\subsection{Stakeholder Interactions and System Impact}

The LungWise system facilitates important interactions between stakeholders that enhance the overall lung cancer care process. Doctors can share AI-generated insights with patients during consultations, promoting informed decision-making and treatment adherence. Hospital administrators can use system data to coordinate resources between clinical staff and support services, ensuring optimal patient care pathways.

Furthermore, the system creates a valuable feedback loop where clinical experiences inform technical improvements. When doctors provide feedback on prediction accuracy or user interface elements, developers can refine the system accordingly. This continuous improvement process ensures the system evolves to meet changing clinical needs and incorporate advances in both medical knowledge and technical capabilities.

By addressing the specific needs of each stakeholder group while facilitating constructive interactions between them, the LungWise system aims to create a comprehensive solution that improves lung cancer outcomes while optimizing healthcare resource utilization.
